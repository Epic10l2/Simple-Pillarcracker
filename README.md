Cracks the Pillarseed using the height of the Pillars.

Valid Pillars are those listed here: https://minecraft.wiki/w/End_spike

Every Pillar can only generate once so only input any of those heights once.

The Pillarcracker also accepts u for unknown, as long as you know 6 pillars you should be fine.(Actually you can just use any non numeric string i was too lazy to fix that.)

Incase you want to run the python file and not the exe follow the following steps.

Download the sourcecode.

Install customtkinter, the easiest way to do so is in an IDE like pycharm where you can easely open the project and type: pip install customtkinter  
In the terminal.

After that just run the python code, you will need to have python installed(made for python 3.12).
