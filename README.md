Cracks the Pillarseed using the height of the Pillars.
Valid Pillars are those listed here: https://minecraft.wiki/w/End_spike
Every Pillar can only generate once so only input any of those heights once.
The Pillarcracker also accepts u for unknown, as long as you know 6 pillars you should be fine.
